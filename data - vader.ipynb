I don’t have kids, and this is the hardest thing for me to understand and make sense of it all. My heart goes out to the parents - single parents, dual parents that brought their children to school to drop them off for classes. I see the images as those young and innocent children cut down by a mad man, with yet another senseless tale of unnecessary violence &amp; gunfire with automatic weapons. When is this going to end? Forget about whose to blame on the scene. From the police officers that immediately went into the building who the public finds out later was fabricated and not true, to the officer that is guarding both the main entrance of the school and walkway is now a ghost. While finger pointing continues, a quiet community is rocked and shaken by this senseless tragedy. When does this end. We as a society have a serious epidemic of senseless violence in America with these long barrel automatic weapons getting into the hands of minors, young teenagers, and those with mental health issues, and criminal records. President Biden, get off your ass and finally do something that no President has done before and end this madness. We need to end this by having Congress exact strict measures and laws implementing the banning of minors, teens, criminals from getting their hands on military assault weapons. There is absolutely no need for this. I don’t have to be a parent to be emotional and know that something needs to be done now. Stop finger pointing and blaming when the real problem is right in front of us all and needs to be addressed and finally stopped. End this epidemic now by stopping the root of the source. Even now as I rant, and venting my frustrations, another senseless act of violence just happened in Philadelphia where multiple gunmen opened fire into crowds of innocent citizens for no reason only to inflict mass casualties, violence, and chaos. We need to push our local selectmen, Mayors, Governors, Senators, and Congressmen and women across the United States to get involved now. President Biden &amp; his Administration along with Congress and the House, all need to start communicating and finally working together to stop this unnecessary violence to finally stop be banning all military long barrel weapons from all, including minors, teenagers, those with criminal records. Our Government needs to make these laws priority to make it virtually impossible for civilians to purchase these weapons and any other handguns over the internet, gun shows, and on the street. We need to do our part now and make a difference do we can finally put a stop to this madness and end this once and for all so that innocent children and all citizens across the United States can feel safe and inclusive.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I am 75-years old.  I have been a legal gun owner for most of my life.  But regardless of my stance on gun ownership, my heart is broken over this incident.  Trust me, there is no gun owner I know that hasn't felt the pain of this tragedy, only a heartless psychopath wouldn't.  *But the major question we should all be addressing is, will making gun ownership more difficult or even impossible actually stop the shootings??  I think everyone knows that the answer to that is, NO.*  There are already so many guns in the streets and homes of America that it's far too late for that, and even through normal people will use them responsibly, the lawless and the mentally ill will always have easy access to them, for there are far more guns that are illegal and unregistered than those that are legal and registered.  So here are a few of my thoughts on violence in American in general.\\n\\n*First, I think there should be a complete media blackout on any story promoting mass murders by anyone, for any reason.*  \\nAnyone who has ever heard the term, \"Copy cat killer\" knows exactly that I'm talking about.  If you noticed, after all of these school shootings, the body count only goes UP, never DOWN.  This is a direct result of publicizing these killings so heavily in the mass media that other young people with access to firearms will immediately want to kill more kids than the PREVIOUS shooter did.  This is the mindset of this kind of killer, regardless of reason, age, or situation.  Although this may sound like a radical request, I believe that by continually saturating the air waves with these kinds of stories, they will most certainly increase.  This is simply not suitable viewing for children.  I find that using gun violence to promote POLITICAL AGENDAS is even more distasteful.  But in the long term, we are ALL guilty of promoting this kind of extreme violence, and here's why.\\n\\nHave you ever seen a typical movie poster?  I bet you'll see a picture of a macho man with a BIG GUN in one hand, and probably a sexy young girl in the other.  Even in today's video games designed for young children — the favorite of prepubescent boys everywhere — they nearly ALWAYS feature warfare and extreme violence, and the more people you kill, the more points you get.  So the fact is, our entire society is so entirely steeped in murder and violence that it is beyond the pale.  Even watching a normally happy Academy Awards show can be permanently turned into a physically violent free-for-all for billions of people all over the world to see.  *These murders unfortunately go far beyond simple mental illness, or the isolated mental issues of an unhappy teen,* but instill in young people's minds the belief that guns, and worse still, the belief that using overt violence is the solution to today's problems.</td>\n",

People need to learn to speak up as this tragedy could've possibly be avoided.   \n",

       "Rob Flanagan           I have been following this story since it unfolded from the very beginning. I’m in my late forties, and a working professional from the Boston area. I don’t have kids, and this is the hardest thing for me to understand and make sense of it all. My heart goes out to the parents - single parents, dual parents that brought their children to school to drop them off for classes. I see the images as those young and innocent children cut down by a mad man, with yet another senseless tale of unnecessary violence & gunfire with automatic weapons. When is this going to end? Forget about whose to blame on the scene. From the police officers that immediately went into the building who the public finds out later was fabricated and not true, to the officer that is guarding both the main entrance of the school and walkway is now a ghost. While finger pointing continues, a quiet community is rocked and shaken by this senseless tragedy. When does this end. We as a society have a serious epidemic of senseless violence in America with these long barrel automatic weapons getting into the hands of minors, young teenagers, and those with mental health issues, and criminal records. President Biden, get off your ass and finally do something that no President has done before and end this madness. We need to end this by having Congress exact strict measures and laws implementing the banning of minors, teens, criminals from getting their hands on military assault weapons. There is absolutely no need for this. I don’t have to be a parent to be emotional and know that something needs to be done now. Stop finger pointing and blaming when the real problem is right in front of us all and needs to be addressed and finally stopped. End this epidemic now by stopping the root of the source. Even now as I rant, and venting my frustrations, another senseless act of violence just happened in Philadelphia where multiple gunmen opened fire into crowds of innocent citizens for no reason only to inflict mass casualties, violence, and chaos. We need to push our local selectmen, Mayors, Governors, Senators, and Congressmen and women across the United States to get involved now. President Biden & his Administration along with Congress and the House, all need to start communicating and finally working together to stop this unnecessary violence to finally stop be banning all military long barrel weapons from all, including minors, teenagers, those with criminal records. Our Government needs to make these laws priority to make it virtually impossible for civilians to purchase these weapons and any other handguns over the internet, gun shows, and on the street. We need to do our part now and make a difference do we can finally put a stop to this madness and end this once and for all so that innocent children and all citizens across the United States can feel safe and inclusive.   \n",

Animal abuse is a major red flag. There’s no magic pill or therapy to cure psychopathy. We really need to educate people about it and how to recognize the signs.

A child deserves ❤️, guidance, attention. If not given, these are the repercussions. \\nAlso a mental health person needs to be addressed, it is dangerous for the being around.\\nIts really disheartened to feel those parents suffering an infinite pain who have lost their kids, nothing in the world could fill their void.   \n",

Parents and families who read this and all over….ACTUALLY PARENT YOUR CHILDREN PROPERLY!!! Be in there loves and involved in all there actions especially if they live under your rooftop!!! Don’t let your children kill innocent people and children!!! Stop just going through the motions and raise the children with morals and principles so they know right from wrong!! Send them into the world as good people so that the world doesn’t have to suffer their evil!! Sup it before it leaves the doors, it all starts at home!!! DO NOT ABUSE THEM IN ANY WAY and DO NOT EXPOSE them to negativity!! Explain what the negatives can lead to in their lives! Show them how remaining positive and with your support, no matter what they’ll over come!!   \n",

This will keep happening. I'm just at a loss for words. It seems like everyone is so desensitized because we forget about it in a few days and only come back to pay attention to issues of gun violence when they happen again like a spectacle. These are children. No child should ever have to see their dead friends and teachers with blood everywhere, let alone be hit with bullets. Those kids were in so much pain. How much can they handle? Little bodies hit with bullets. What are the families thinking? It was just another school day and you should expect to see your baby again safe and sound. I don't even know what to do anymore. How many petitions and pleas for lawmakers have to be signed before this stops? Because it sure as hell doesn't happen in other countries. There's something missing here.   \n",

We should be questioning what made him behave so sociopathic and we should seek how to prevent this happening to other individuals so that they don't harm themselves and others. Simply banning guns or making them more difficult to obtain is -sadly- not enough.   \n",
       "tiffsaver                                                                          I am 75-years old.  I have been a legal gun owner for most of my life.  But regardless of my stance on gun ownership, my heart is broken over this incident.  Trust me, there is no gun owner I know that hasn't felt the pain of this tragedy, only a heartless psychopath wouldn't.  *But the major question we should all be addressing is, will making gun ownership more difficult or even impossible actually stop the shootings??  I think everyone knows that the answer to that is, NO.*  There are already so many guns in the streets and homes of America that it's far too late for that, and even through normal people will use them responsibly, the lawless and the mentally ill will always have easy access to them, for there are far more guns that are illegal and unregistered than those that are legal and registered.  So here are a few of my thoughts on violence in American in general.\\n\\n*First, I think there should be a complete media blackout on any story promoting mass murders by anyone, for any reason.*  \\nAnyone who has ever heard the term, \"Copy cat killer\" knows exactly that I'm talking about.  If you noticed, after all of these school shootings, the body count only goes UP, never DOWN.  This is a direct result of publicizing these killings so heavily in the mass media that other young people with access to firearms will immediately want to kill more kids than the PREVIOUS shooter did.  This is the mindset of this kind of killer, regardless of reason, age, or situation.  Although this may sound like a radical request, I believe that by continually saturating the air waves with these kinds of stories, they will most certainly increase.  This is simply not suitable viewing for children.  I find that using gun violence to promote POLITICAL AGENDAS is even more distasteful.  But in the long term, we are ALL guilty of promoting this kind of extreme violence, and here's why.\\n\\nHave you ever seen a typical movie poster?  I bet you'll see a picture of a macho man with a BIG GUN in one hand, and probably a sexy young girl in the other.  Even in today's video games designed for young children — the favorite of prepubescent boys everywhere — they nearly ALWAYS feature warfare and extreme violence, and the more people you kill, the more points you get.  So the fact is, our entire society is so entirely steeped in murder and violence that it is beyond the pale.  Even watching a normally happy Academy Awards show can be permanently turned into a physically violent free-for-all for billions of people all over the world to see.  *These murders unfortunately go far beyond simple mental illness, or the isolated mental issues of an unhappy teen,* but instill in young people's minds the belief that guns, and worse still, the belief that using overt violence is the solution to today's problems.   \n",

The same way as always. Everyone ignores all the signs and his care takers don’t have a freakin clue what’s happening with him.

Drugs like Xanas and Ritlin have proven suicidal and  murderous ideation side effects proven in court in liability cases. \\n\\nWhat has changed to make this happen: we drugged an entire generation with drugs that most of Europe has ruled are destructive and illegal to give to children under 18.   \n",

His knuckles were white. This went on for a while and made me nervous especially since he was being anti-social and \"strange.\" I eventually went to a flight attendant to tell her what I was observing and she just looked at me like I was freaking nuts and \"how dare you bother me.\" Well, these guy never stabbed anyone or hurt anyone but someone else complained about him also. Finally, at baggage claim, this person finally had an outburst screaming and flailing his arms like a lunatic. I was right - there was something wrong with this person. Security escorted him away. My point is that I told the flight attendants about him and they did nothing and just blew me off. No one gives a crap about warnings. What's the point of even trying to be proactive when no one cares?   \n",

My heart and my prayers are with all the families and friends who are grieving. The individuals who failed to protect the victims as well as the officials who refuse to rein in the sale of weapons designed for combat are responsible. They might not be punished on this earth, but they will not be able to avoid accountability in front of the eternal throne. Why does the Republican party oppose guns reforms? They would feel otherwise if it was their children or grandchildren massacred needlessly. Remember Uvalde when you vote. The United States should look at Australia and the manner they dealt with guns and gun control. Australia has put the welfare of their citizens over profits and politics. It's time that we do the same to save innocent lives. Shame, shame, shame on us!   \n",

My heart goes out to the families of the victims as I know they are experiencing pain that will never go away. My nephew was gunned down in 1985 and to this day my family is affected by that loss. My prayers go up for the families, loved ones, and classmates and fellow staff of these children and teachers.   \n",

Thank you Your Majesty for inventing the Paddington Bear so he could thank you for everything. At first I didn’t believe that the queen dressed a yellow-blue dress on her holiday, it really suits her, but when I saw Paddington during the meeting (he was voiced in Ukrainian by Zelensky), I burst into tears. I didn't expect this kind of support! Thank you!   \n",
